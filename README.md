# smart-lock-using-NFC
This project implements a smart lock system using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. Users can unlock the system using an NFC card/tag. The system consists of an Arduino/Raspberry Pi, an NFC module (RC522), and a servo/magnetic lock. It enhances security by allowing only authorized NFC tags to access the lock.
